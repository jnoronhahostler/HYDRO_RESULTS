# HYDRO_RESULTS
Theory calculations from v-USPhydro for various initial conditions, energies, ions, and medium parameters

There are three different scenarios included in these results:

S1 means eta/s=0.05 and dE/dx~L 

S3 means eta/s=0.12 and dE/dx~L

L2 means eta/s=0.05 and dE/dx~L^2

NOTE:  eta/s=0.05 fits the soft physics regime for ALICE data the best whereas eta/s=0.012 underpredicts the data.  

Our predictions run from pT=10-100 GeV. All flow calculations include centrality rebinning and multiplicity weighing and are calculated using the scalar product method. These results are for identified hadrons.

********** OBSERVABLES ************

RAA(pT)

vn{2}(pT) and vn{4}(pT) all calculated using the scalar product method for v2-v6

Normalized symmetric cumulants across pT NSC(pT) for NSC(3,2), NSC(4,2), and NSC(4,3).  We assume that the high pT particle always comes from the lowest order flow harmonic (so either v2 or v3) and it is always 1 high pT particle correlated with 3 low pT particles.

The models is v-USPhydro+BBMG Phys.Rev.Lett. 116 (2016) no.25, 252301 and the predictions for 5.02 TeV for RAA and flow are from arXiv:1609.05171 .  The paper on NSC(pT) will be released shortly.
